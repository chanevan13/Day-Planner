## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I was motivated by this project because I could learn how to create a tool that has many practical uses not just for myself in everyday life, but for many other projects and applications. I am still learning how to better sort each day with color coding. I learned how to better use Day.js and save data to the local storage so when i refresh the page the content can be saved.
